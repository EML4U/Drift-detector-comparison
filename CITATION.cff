    abstract: >-
      Collections of text documents such as product
      reviews and microblogs often evolve over time. In
      practice, however, classifiers trained on them are
      updated infrequently, leading to performance
      degradation over time.While approaches for
      automatic drift detection have been proposed, they
      were often designed for low-dimensional sensor
      data, and it is unclear how well they perform for
      state-of-the-art text classifiers based on
      high-dimensional document embeddings. In this
      paper, we empirically compare drift detectors on
      document embeddings on two benchmarking datasets
      with varying amounts of drift. Our results show
      that multivariate drift detectors based on the
      Kernel Two-Sample Test and Least-Squares Density
      Difference outperform univariate drift detectors
      based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. Moreover, our
      experiments show that current drift detectors
      perform better on smaller embedding dimensions.
